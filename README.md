# Hangman game
This is a digital modificationn of the classic children's game of Hangman
A player's objective is to identify a secret word of which only the number of letters is originally revealed by lines. In each round, the player guesses a letter of the alphabet: if it's present in the word, it is revealed, otherwise one of the hangman's body parts is drawn in. The game ends in a win if the word is entirely revealed by correct guesses, and ends in loss if the hangman's body is completely revealed instead. To assist the player, a visible record of all guessed letters is maintained.
